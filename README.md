# Conway's Game of Life in python

I wanted to learn Python so my good friend [Rodrigo Garc√≠a](https://github.com/rgarcia-herrera) suggested that I write Conway's Game of Life as a means to get a grip on the data types, structures and so on.

Python is beautiful and I had a lot of fun writing this!
